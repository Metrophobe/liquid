## Liquid Gallery - Tribute to H.R. Giger ##

A few years ago someone asked me to do something with heightmaps and particles traversing luminance. Some other people were expermenting with this idea. So here you have it, a tiny demo utilising 10k particles and some athmospheric audio from Brimstone (amazing music by the way).  H.R Giger
